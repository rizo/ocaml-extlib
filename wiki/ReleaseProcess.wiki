#summary Release process - how to make a new release?

= Release process =

 # Test that the current trunk is working by compiling and running the test suite
{{{
cd ocaml-extlib/trunk/test
make 
make run
make opt
make run
}}}
 # Inspect the results.  *All* test cases must pass in both byte code and native code.
  * Also run tests with the extlib version that's installed on ocamlfind, with `make USE_OCAMLFIND=1`.  If the release fixes any bugs, the previously ocamlfind extlib should fail some test cases
 # Create release
  * Increment VERSION in Makefile, commit
  * `make release` will create directory `extlib-VERSION` and release tarball `extlib-VERSION.tar.gz` 
 # QA released extlib version once again, by installing it with ocamlfind and running test suite.
 # Tag the release, by running `svn copy` as suggested by `make release`
  * svn copy https://ocaml-extlib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://ocaml-extlib.googlecode.com/svn/tags/extlib-VERSION`
  * Mention trunk revision in the commit message
 # Upload the release tarball to http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-extlib/downloads
 # Update API reference and changelog:
  * Compile the API ref by running `make doc` in `trunk/extlib`
  * `cp trunk/extlib/doc/* doc/apiref/`
  * Commit change to SVN (review `svn st` for added files)
  * Update wiki/ReleaseNotes.wiki
 # Announce the new extlib release on OCaml & extlib mailing lists.
